# visual-image-organizer
Personal project to reorganize images visually using the name of the files or name of the file. So based on the ordering of the images within the program, 
left to right top to bottom like standard english, its possible to order the modified dates of the files in ascending order or descending order. 

# example
# Ascending modified date
Ascending would mean that left to right means the modified date ascends or increase in the second created based on the time the program runs it.

# Name
Will simply rename using a-i, where left to right will become a-0, a-1, a-2, a-3, etc
